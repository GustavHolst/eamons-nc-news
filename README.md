# ES News

ES News is a place for people (mostly Mr Men & Women) to get together to discuss their favorite topics, be that Football, Coding or Cooking.

Users can view articles and comments (which are filterable and sortable), write their own articles,comment on articles, as well as up and down vote any articles or comments they like or dislike.

Each user has their own profile page, which lists out any articles they've posted.

Guests can also use the site but are not able to post or up/downvote any articles or comments.
